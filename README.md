# 📚 Library Management System

A command-line based **Library Management System** developed in Python. This project demonstrates how to build a complete inventory management tool for a library using core programming concepts such as file handling, data storage, user interaction, and modular code structure.

The system allows librarians or administrators to manage a collection of books — including adding new books, issuing them to users, and tracking returns — all through a user-friendly terminal interface.
